# Machine learning model to predict the price of properties in Lekki, Lagos based on its features. 

Excluding Banana Island in Lagos, Ikoyi has the most expensive houses in Nigeria, Closely Followed by Maitama District in Abuja.
factors responsible for the prices of houses in lekki is the number of bedrooms, the less rooms, the less expensive. the more rooms, the greater the valuation.
Infact, one room should cost about 20 million naira on average. The number of rooms times 20 million naira.   + or - 1 million naira will get you closer to the overall price of the house.
Surprisingly, an apartment in a Block of Flats will cost about 17 million naira. + or - 1 million naira more than a Detached Duplex on average.
If the house is a Semi-detached Bungalow, the price should depreciate by about 16.5 million naira. + 0r - 1.5 Million naira.  
My hypothesis is that the Semi-detached Bungalow does not appeal as much to the inhabitants, thus it does not have a positive appeal as a luxury house to the degree comparable to 'Block of flats', 'Terraced Bungalow' and 'Detached Duplex'  .
Some features are highly correlated. For example, the more number of bedrooms, the more the bathrooms,  so the number of bathrooms is not needed for the model to predict the price of a house.
The number of parking spaces in a house contributes to the overall price of the house with one parking space contributing about 3.5  million naira. + or - 1 million naira to the overall price of the house.
